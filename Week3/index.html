<h1>Modularity</h1>
<p>
I chose to use Github as my website for Modularity. Github has a lot of different systems that work together to create the experience you want. It also can be modified in sections without making other sections stop working. This allows users to customize their experience, all because it is modular.

<h1>Mapping</h1>
<p>
For mapping I decided to use ADobe's Kuler, a color picking tool. The controls do exactly what you would expect without explanation. the sliders correspond to the colors that they are on top of. as well as moving the circles moves to the color you want. Very good interface for controlling various variables.

<h1>Signal to Noise Ratio</h1>
<p>
I used MEta-news for signal to noise ratio. This is a news aggregate site and presents you with a ton of information in a small space. It also does not have any ads. If you are going to this site, you are looking for news, and this delivers without distracting you with other things. very high signal to noise ratio.

<h1>Ockham's Razor</h1>
<p>
I chose to use Pandora for ockham's razor. There are many different and smaller music streaming platforms out there but Pandora is one of the best. part of this is due to how simple it is for the user to interact with. At its heart all you have to do is name one song or band and then just listen. You will occasionally have to interact with it, but for the most part that is it. no fussing over what to play it just does it for you. very simple and that has made it become so popular.

<h1>Chunking</h1>
<p>
I chose Trello for chunking, and it is not a traditional choice. This is all user in putted content and information, however Trello provides a very specific frame work for it. By allowing you to organize information into boards and task it lets the user interact with their level on different levels. you may not want to know every single thing that needs to be done so you can get an overview of categories to get an idea of what needs to be done without overwhelming someone with a huge amount of things. and then a user can select a subcategory and get more information, on the chunk they want. a good tool for organizing large amounts of information.
