	I prefer to use comps instead of style tiles. I feel like there is not that much of a time difference when it comes to the two of them but comps lets you visualize the website that you are creating much better. While it would be possible to put too much time into a comp and make it too detailed, I feel like any time put into the style tiles does not really help you build the look of the site. yes you can get an idea and maybe a theme, but if you are planning on having something to show it would be much more beneficial to do a comp than a style tile so that the client has a much better idea of the plan.
